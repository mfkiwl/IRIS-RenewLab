This this the changelog file for the SoapyIris project.

Release 2020.02.0.1 (2020-02-10)
==========================

- Buffer alignment for DMA calls
- Support FFT enabled RF core:
  - async overflow reporting
  - arbitrary transmit flags
  - ttd disables tx flow control
- Switch to SoapySDR logger for stream status indicators
- Added support for setting SO_PRIORITY on tx sockets

Release 2019.01.0.1 (2019-02-04)
==========================

- Increased the default discovery timeout to 300 us
- Increase stream buffer to support 8kib jumbo packets
- Embed a route into the Tx packet header for hub support

Release 2018.12.0.1 (2018-12-27)
==========================

- Added --img support for flasher script
- TDD mode settings for streaming with TDD framer module

Release 2018.08.0.1 (2018-08-28)
==========================

- Converter support for dual channel complex 8-bit streaming
- Switch to TWBW64 framing mode for Rx/Tx streams + status
- Remove driver series check, just compare firmware vs FPGA.
  The print was basically always out of date and we just need
  to confirm that the streaming protocol is actually matched.

Release 2018.05.0.2 (2018-08-28)
==========================
